A cosmopolitan display of knowledge about modern classical music enabled artists such as Duke Ellington to counter misconceptions that jazz musicians were untutored. Yet jazz musicians' interest in classical music was often taken as an admission that jazz innovations were derived from European sources. After Charlie Parker expressed admiration for Bartók, an interviewer asked if Parker's musical innovations were adaptations of classical predecessors' ideas. Often, comparisons with modern European composers connected jazz to the presumed superior standards of classical music without recognizing that jazz articulated its own musical vision—by developing expressive and improvisational principles rooted in a wide variety of African American musics—that challenged the hegemony of European standards in American music.",

However, although red maples' photosynthetic performance and biomass production have increased in response to elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, these increases are not necessarily greater than those of co-occurring tree species, such as oak. Other possible explanations include the deliberate suppression of fire during the twentieth century (red maples are more sensitive to fire than are many other trees), red maples' ability to thrive in a wide variety of soil conditions, and their unique ability to thrive in both young and mature forests. Increased deer browsing of oak foliage and seeds (acorns), owing to larger deer populations, may be yet another cause. Deer do browse heavily during winter on red maple twigs (red maple foliage, on the other hand, may contain deer-deterring alkaloids), and a high percentage of red maple seeds are consumed by various animals. However, deer browse on oak primarily during summer when the impact of browsing on tree growth and survival is greatest, and oaks release seeds less frequently than do red maples.",

Despite her towering reputation in her own day, Addams had been neglected by academic historians-too much a crossover act for women's history, too much an activist for intellectual history, largely ignored by political history. Her concern for the poor registered as genuine but ineffectual. Against the turn-of-the-century backdrop of massive strikes and class hatred, Addams' commitment to mediation, conciliation, and cooperation looked ill equipped for the bitter politics of the day. In the 1990s, however, historians grew more curious about Addams' Progressive-movement politics. At one time judged conservative, even reactionary, the Progressives and their considerable accomplishments- the fruits of steady, incremental reform–began to look appealing.",

Rather than being government sponsored and limited to murals on government buildings, the contemporary mural movement sprang from the people themselves, with murals appearing on community buildings and throughout college campuses. Perhaps the biggest difference, however, is the process. In early twentieth- century Mexico, murals resulted from the vision of individual artists. But today's murals are characteristically the products of artists working with local residents on design and creation. <br/> Such community engagement is characteristic of the Chicano (Mexican American) art movement as a whole, which evolved from the same foundations as the Chicano civil rights movement of the mid-1960s. Both were a direct response to the needs of Mexican Americans in the UnitedStates, who were fighting for the right to adequate education, political empowerment, and decent working conditions. Artists joined other cultural workers in making political statements and played a keyrole in taking these statements to the public. They developed collectives and established cultural centers that functioned as the public- relations arm of the Chicano sociopolitical movement.",
