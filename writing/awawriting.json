    "question": "'We can usually learn much more from people whose views we share than from people whose views contradict our own'; disagreement can cause stress and inhibit learning.",
    "answer": "Do we learn more from people whose ideas we share in common than from those whose ideas contradict ours? The speaker claims so, for the reason that disagreement can cause stress and inhibit learning. I concede that undue discord can impede learning. Otherwise, in my view we learn far more from discourse and debate with those whose ideas we oppose than from people whose ideas are in accord with our own.\n\nAdmittedly, under some circumstances disagreement with others can be counterproductive to learning. For supporting examples one need look no further than a television set. On today's typical television or radio talk show, disagreement usually manifests itself in meaningless rhetorical bouts and shouting matches, during which opponents vie to have their own message heard, but have little interest either in finding common ground with or in acknowledging the merits of the opponent's viewpoint. Understandably, neither the combatants nor the viewers learn anything meaningful. In fact, these battles only serve to reinforce the predispositions and biases of all concerned. The end result is that learning is impeded.\n\nDisagreement can also inhibit learning when two opponents disagree on fundamental assumptions needed for meaningful discourse and debate. For example, a student of paleontology learns little about the evolution of an animal species under current study by debating with an individual whose religious belief system precludes the possibility of evolution to begin with. And, economics and finance students learn little about the dynamics of a laissez-faire system by debating with a socialist whose view is that a centralized power should control all economic activity.\n\nAside from the foregoing two provisos, however, I fundamentally disagree with the speaker's claim. Assuming common ground between two rational and reasonable opponents willing to debate on intellectual merits, both opponents stand to gain much from that debate. Indeed it is primarily through such debate that human knowledge advances, whether at the personal, community, or global level.\n\nAt the personal level, by listening to their parents' rationale for their seemingly oppressive rules and policies teenagers can learn how certain behaviors naturally carry certain undesirable consequences. At the same time, by listening to their teenagers' concerns about autonomy and about peer pressures parents can learn the valuable lesson that effective parenting and control are two different things. At the community level, through dispassionate dialogue an environmental activist can come to understand the legitimate economic concerns of those whose jobs depend on the continued profitable operation of a factory. Conversely, the latter might stand to learn much about the potential public health price to be paid by ensuring job growth and a low unemployment rate. Finally, at the global level, two nations with opposing political or economic interests can reach mutually beneficial agreements by striving to understand the other's legitimate concerns for its national security, its political sovereignty, the stability of its economy and currency, and so forth.\n\nIn sum, unless two opponents in a debate are each willing to play on the same field and by the same rules, I concede that disagreement can impede learning. Otherwise, reasoned discourse and debate between people with opposing viewpoints is the very foundation upon which human knowledge advances. Accordingly, on balance the speaker is fundamentally correct."

    "question": "No field of study can advance significantly unless outsiders bring their knowledge and experience to that field of study.",
    "answer": "I strongly agree with the assertion that significant advances in knowledge require expertise from various fields. The world around us presents a seamless web of physical and anthropogenic forces, which interact in ways that can be understood only in the context of a variety of disciplines. Two examples that aptly illustrate this point involve the fields of cultural anthropology and astronomy.\n\nConsider how a cultural anthropologist's knowledge about an ancient civilization is enhanced not only by the expertise of the archeologist—who unearths the evidence—but ultimately by the expertise of biochemists, geologists, linguists, and even astronomers. By analyzing the hair, nails, blood, and bones of mummified bodies, biochemists and forensic scientists can determine the life expectancy, general well-being, and common causes of death of the population. These experts can also ensure the proper preservation of evidence found at the archaeological site. A geologist can help identify the source and age of the materials used for tools, weapons, and structures—thereby enabling the anthropologist to extrapolate about the civilization's economy, trades and work habits, lifestyles, extent of travel and mobility, and so forth. Linguists are needed to interpret hieroglyphics and extrapolate from found fragments of writings. And an astronomer can help explain the layout of an ancient city as well as the design, structure, and position of monuments, tombs, and temples—since ancients often looked to the stars for guidance in building cities and structures.\n\nAn even more striking example of how expertise in diverse fields is needed to advance knowledge involves the area of astronomy and space exploration. Significant advancements in our knowledge of the solar system and the universe require increasingly keen tools for observation and measurement. Telescope technology and the measurement of celestial distances, masses, volumes, and so forth, are the domain of astrophysicists.\n\nThese advances also require increasingly sophisticated means of exploration. Manned and unmanned exploratory probes are designed by mechanical, electrical, and computer engineers. And to build and enable these technologies requires the acumen and savvy of business leaders, managers, and politicians. Even diplomats might play a role—insofar as major space projects require international cooperative efforts among the world's scientists and governments. And ultimately, it is our philosophers whose expertise helps provide meaning to what we learn about our universe.\n\nIn sum, no area of intellectual inquiry operates in a vacuum. Because the sciences are inextricably related, to advance our knowledge in any one area we must understand the interplay among them all. Moreover, it is our non-scientists who make possible the science and who bring meaning to what we learn from it."

    "question": "A nation should require all its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college rather than allow schools in different parts of the nation to determine which academic courses to offer.",
    "answer": "The speaker would prefer a national curriculum for all children up until college instead of allowing schools in different regions the freedom to decide on their own curricula. I agree insofar as some common core curriculum would serve useful purposes for any nation. At the same time, however, individual states and communities should have some freedom to augment any such curriculum as they see fit; otherwise, a nation's educational system might defeat its own purposes in the long term.\n\nA national core curriculum would be beneficial to a nation in a number of respects. First of all, by providing all children with fundamental skills and knowledge, a common core curriculum would help ensure that our children grow up to become reasonably informed, productive members of society. In addition, a common core curriculum would provide a predictable foundation upon which college administrators and faculty could more easily build curricula and select course materials for freshmen that are neither below nor above their level of educational experience. Finally, a core curriculum would ensure that all school children are taught core values upon which any democratic society depends to thrive, and even survive—values such as tolerance of others with different viewpoints, and respect for others.\n\nHowever, a common curriculum that is also an exclusive one would pose certain problems, which might outweigh the benefits noted above. First of all, on what basis would certain coursework be included or excluded, and who would be the final decision-maker? In all likelihood, these decisions would be in the hands of federal legislators and regulators, who are likely to have their own quirky notions of what should and should not be taught to children—notions that may or may not reflect those of most communities, schools, or parents. Besides, government officials are notoriously susceptible to influence-peddling by lobbyists who do not have the best interests of society's children in mind.\n\nSecondly, an official, federally sanctioned curriculum would facilitate the dissemination of propaganda and other dogma which, because of its biased and one-sided nature, undermines the very purpose of true education: to enlighten. I can easily foresee the banning of certain textbooks, programs, and websites which provide information and perspectives that the government might wish to suppress—as some sort of threat to its authority and power. Although this scenario might seem far-fetched, these sorts of concerns are being raised already at the state level.\n\nIn the final analysis, homogenization of elementary and secondary education would amount to a double-edged sword. While it would serve as an insurance policy against a future populated with illiterates and ignoramuses, at the same time it might serve to obliterate cultural diversity and tradition. The optimal federal approach, in my view, is a balanced one that imposes a basic curriculum yet leaves the rest up to each state—or better yet, to each community."

    "question": "The video camera provides such an accurate and convincing record of contemporary life that it has become a more important form of documentation than written records.",
    "answer": "According to the speaker, the video recording is a more important means of documenting contemporary life than a written record because video recordings are more accurate and convincing. Although I agree that a video provides a more objective and accurate record of an event's spatial aspects, there is far more to document in life than what we see and hear. Thus, the speaker overstates the comparative significance of video as a documentary tool.\n\nNonetheless, for certain other purposes, written records are advantageous and more appropriate than video records. For example, certain legal matters are best left to written documentation: video is of no practical use in documenting the terms of a complex contractual agreement, an incorporation, or the establishment of a trust. And video is of little use when it comes to documenting a person's subjective state of mind, impressions, or reflections of an event or experience. Indeed, to the extent that personal interpretation adds dimension and richness to the record, written documentation is actually more important than video.\n\nIn sum, the speaker's claim overstates the importance of video records, at least to some extent. When it comes to capturing, storing, and recalling temporal, spatial events, video records are inherently more objective, accurate, and complete. However, what we view through a camera lens provides only one dimension of our life and times; written documentation will always be needed to quantify, demystify, and provide meaning to the world around us."

    "question": "It is often necessary, even desirable, for political leaders to withhold information from the public.",
    "answer": "I agree with the speaker that it is sometimes necessary, and even desirable, for political leaders to withhold information from the public. A contrary view would reveal a naiveté about the inherent nature of public politics, and about the sorts of compromises on the part of well-intentioned political leaders necessary in order to further the public's ultimate interests. Nevertheless, we must not allow our political leaders undue freedom to withhold information, otherwise, we risk sanctioning demagoguery and undermining the philosophical underpinnings of any democratic society.\n\nOne reason for my fundamental agreement with the speaker is that in order to gain the opportunity for effective public leadership, a would-be leader must first gain and maintain political power. In the game of politics, complete forthrightness is a sign of vulnerability and naivete, neither of which earn a politician respect among his or her opponents, and which those opponents will use to every advantage to defeat the politician. In my observation, some measure of pandering to the electorate is necessary to gain and maintain political leadership. For example, were all politicians to fully disclose every personal foible, character flaw, and detail concerning personal life, few honest politicians would ever be elected. While this view might seem cynical, personal scandals have in fact proven the undoing of many a political career; thus, I think this view is realistic.\n\nAnother reason why I essentially agree with the speaker is that fully disclosing to the public certain types of information would threaten public safety and perhaps even national security. For example, if the President were to disclose the government's strategies for thwarting specific plans of an international terrorist or a drug trafficker, those strategies would surely fail, and the public's health and safety would be compromised as a result. Withholding information might also be necessary to avoid public panic. While such cases are rare, they do occur occasionally. For example, during the first few hours of the new millennium, the U.S. Pentagon's missile defense system experienced a Y2K-related malfunction. This fact was withheld from the public until later in the day, once the problem had been solved; and legitimately so, since immediate disclosure would have served no useful purpose and might even have resulted in mass hysteria.\n\nHaving recognized that withholding information from the public is often necessary to serve the interests of that public, legitimate political leadership nevertheless requires forthrightness with the citizenry as to the leader's motives and agenda. History informs us that would-be leaders who lack such forthrightness are the same ones who seize and maintain power either by brute force or by demagoguery—that is, by deceiving and manipulating the citizenry. Paragons such as Genghis Khan and Hitler, respectively, come immediately to mind. Any democratic society should of course abhor demagoguery, which operates against the democratic principle of government by the people. Consider also less egregious examples, such as President Nixon's withholding of information about his active role in the Watergate cover-up. His behavior demonstrated a concern for self-interest above the broader interests of the democratic system that granted his political authority in the first place.\n\nIn sum, the game of politics calls for a certain amount of disingenuousness and lack of forthrightness that we might otherwise characterize as dishonesty. And such behavior is a necessary means to the final objective of effective political leadership. Nevertheless, in any democracy, a leader who relies chiefly on deception and secrecy to preserve that leadership, to advance a private agenda, or to conceal selfish motives, betrays the democracy—and ends up forfeiting the political game."

    "question": "Governments must ensure that their major cities receive the financial support they need in order to thrive, because it is primarily in cities that a nation's cultural traditions are preserved and generated.",
    "answer": "The speaker's claim is actually threefold: (1) ensuring the survival of large cities and, in turn, that of cultural traditions, is a proper function of government; (2) government support is needed for our large cities and cultural traditions to survive and thrive; and (3) cultural traditions are preserved and generated primarily in our large cities. I strongly disagree with all three claims. First of all, subsidizing cultural traditions is not a proper role of government. Admittedly, certain objectives, such as public health and safety, are so essential to the survival of large cities and of nations that government has a duty to ensure that they are met. However, these objectives should not extend tenuously to preserving cultural traditions. Moreover, government cannot possibly play an evenhanded role as cultural patron. Inadequate resources call for restrictions, priorities, and choices. It is unconscionable to relegate normative decisions as to which cities or cultural traditions are more deserving, valuable, or needy to a few legislators, whose notions about culture might be misguided or unrepresentative of those of the general populace. Also, legislators are all too likely to make choices in favor of the cultural agendas of their home towns and states, or of lobbyists with the most money and influence. \n\nSecondly, subsidizing cultural traditions is not a necessary role of government. A lack of private funding might justify an exception. However, culture--by which I chiefly mean the fine arts--has always depended primarily on the patronage of private individuals and businesses, and not on the government. The Medicis, a powerful banking family of Renaissance Italy, supported artists Michelangelo and Raphael. During the 20th Century the primary source of cultural support were private foundations established by industrial magnates Carnegie, Mellon, Rockefeller and Getty. And tomorrow cultural support will come from our new technology and media moguls----including the likes of Ted Turner and Bill Gates. In short, philanthropy is alive and well today, and so government need not intervene to ensure that our cultural traditions are preserved and promoted.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, the speaker unfairly suggests that large cities serve as the primary breeding ground and sanctuaries for a nation's cultural traditions. Today a nation's distinct cultural traditions--its folk art, crafts, traditional songs, customs and ceremonies--burgeon instead in small towns and rural regions. Admittedly, our cities do serve as our centers for 'high art'; big cities are where we deposit, display, and boast the world's preeminent art, architecture, and music. But big-city culture has little to do anymore with one nation's distinct cultural traditions. After all, modern cities are essentially multicultural stew pots; accordingly, by assisting large cities a government is actually helping to create a global culture as well to subsidize the traditions of other nations' cultures.\n\nIn the final analysis, government cannot philosophically justify assisting large cities for the purpose of either promoting or preserving the nation's cultural traditions; nor is government assistance necessary toward these ends. Moreover, assisting large cities would have little bearing on our distinct cultural traditions, which abide elsewhere."

    "question": "All nations should help support the development of a global university designed to engage students in the process of solving the world's most persistent social problems.",
    "answer": "I agree that it would serve the interests of all nations to establish a global university for the purpose of solving the world's most persistent social problems. Nevertheless, such a university poses certain risks which all participating nations must be careful to minimize—or risk defeating the university's purpose.\n\nOne compelling argument in favor of a global university has to do with the fact that its faculty and students would bring diverse cultural and educational perspectives to the problems they seek to solve. It seems to me that nations can only benefit from a global university where students learn ways in which other nations address certain social problems—successfully or not. It might be tempting to think that an overly diversified academic community would impede communication among students and faculty. However, in my view, any such concerns are unwarranted, especially considering the growing awareness of other peoples and cultures which the mass media, and especially the Internet, have created. Moreover, many basic principles used to solve enduring social problems know no national boundaries; thus, a useful insight or discovery can come from a researcher or student from any nation.\n\nAnother compelling argument for a global university involves the increasingly global nature of certain problems. Consider, for instance, the depletion of atmospheric ozone, which has warmed the Earth to the point that it threatens the very survival of the human species. Also, we are now learning that clear-cutting the world's rainforests can set into motion a chain of animal extinctions that threaten the delicate balance upon which all animals—including humans—depend. Also, consider that a financial crisis, a political crisis, or a natural disaster in one country can spell trouble for foreign companies, many of which are now multinational in that they rely on the labor forces, equipment, and raw materials of other nations. Environmental, economic, and political problems such as these all carry grave social consequences—increased crime, unemployment, insurrection, hunger, and so forth. Solving these problems requires global cooperation—which a global university can facilitate.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing reasons why a global university would help solve many of our most pressing social problems, the establishment of such a university poses certain problems of its own which must be addressed in order that the university can achieve its objectives. First, participant nations would need to overcome a myriad of administrative and political impediments. All nations would need to agree on which problems demand the university's attention and resources, which areas of academic research are worthwhile, as well as agree on policies and procedures for making, enforcing, and amending these decisions. Query whether a functional global university is politically feasible, given that sovereign nations naturally wish to advance their own agendas.\n\nA second problem inherent in establishing a global university involves the risk that certain intellectual and research avenues would become officially sanctioned while others of equal or greater potential value would be discouraged, or perhaps even proscribed. A telling example of the inherent danger of setting and enforcing official research priorities involves the Soviet government's attempts during the 1920s to not only control the direction and the goals of its scientists' research but also to distort the outcome of that research—ostensibly for the greatest good of the greatest number of people. Not surprisingly, during this time period, no significant scientific advances occurred under the auspices of the Soviet government. The Soviet lesson provides an important caveat to administrators of a global university: Significant progress in solving pressing social problems requires an open mind to all sound ideas, approaches, and theories—irrespective of the ideologies of their proponents.\n\nA final problem with a global university is that the world's preeminent intellectual talent might be drawn to the sorts of problems to which the university is charged with solving, while parochial social problems go unsolved. While this is not reason enough not to establish a global university, it nevertheless is a concern that university administrators and participant nations must be aware of in allocating resources and intellectual talent.\n\nTo sum up, given the increasingly global nature of the world's social problems, and the escalating costs of addressing these problems, a global university makes good sense. And, since all nations would have a common interest in seeing this endeavor succeed, my intuition is that participating nations would be able to overcome whatever procedural and political obstacles that might stand in the way of success. As long as each nation is careful not to neglect its own unique social problems, and as long as the university's administrators are careful to remain open-minded about the legitimacy and potential value of various avenues of intellectual inquiry and research, a global university might go a long way toward solving many of the world's pressing social problems."

    "question": "Many of the world's lesser-known languages are being lost as fewer and fewer people speak them. The governments of countries in which these languages are spoken should act to prevent such languages from becoming extinct.",
    "answer": "The speaker asserts that governments of countries where lesser-known languages are spoken should intervene to prevent these languages from becoming extinct. I agree insofar as a country's indigenous and distinct languages should not be abandoned and forgotten altogether. At some point, however, I think cultural identity should yield to the more practical considerations of day-to-day life in a global society.\n\nOn the one hand, the indigenous language of any geographical region is part-and-parcel of the cultural heritage of the region's natives. In my observation, we humans have a basic psychological need for individual identity, which we define by way of our membership in distinct cultural groups. A culture defines itself in various ways—by its unique traditions, rituals, mores, attitudes, and beliefs, but especially language. Therefore, when a people's language becomes extinct, the result is a diminished sense of pride, dignity, and self-worth.\n\nOne need look no further than continental Europe to observe how people cling tenaciously to their distinct languages, despite the fact that there is no practical need for them anymore. And on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, the French Canadians stubbornly insist on French as their official language, for the sole purpose of preserving their distinct cultural heritage. Even where no distinct language exists, people will invent one to gain a sense of cultural identity, as the emergence of the distinct Ebonic cant among today's African Americans aptly illustrates. In short, people resist language assimilation because of a basic human need to be part of a distinct cultural group.\n\nAnother important reason to prevent the extinction of a language is to preserve the distinct ideas that only that particular language can convey. Certain Native American and Oriental languages, for instance, contain words symbolizing spiritual and other abstract concepts that only these cultures embrace. Thus, in some cases, to lose a language would be to abandon cherished beliefs and ideas that can be conveyed only through language.\n\nOn the other hand, in today's high-tech world of satellite communications, global mobility, and especially the Internet, language barriers serve primarily to impede cross-cultural communication, which in turn impedes international commerce and trade. Moreover, language barriers naturally breed misunderstanding, a certain distrust, and, as a result, discord and even war among nations. Moreover, in my view, the extinction of all but a few major languages is inexorable—as supported by the fact that the Internet has adopted English as its official language. Thus, by intervening to preserve a dying language, a government might be deploying its resources to fight a losing battle, rather than to combat more pressing social problems—such as hunger, homelessness, disease, and ignorance—that plague nearly every society today.\n\nIn sum, preserving indigenous languages is, admittedly, a worthy goal; maintaining its own distinct language affords a people a sense of pride, dignity, and self-worth. Moreover, by preserving languages, we honor a people's heritage, enhance our understanding of history, and preserve certain ideas that only some languages properly convey. Nevertheless, the economic and political drawbacks of language barriers outweigh the benefits of preserving a dying language. In the final analysis, the government should devote its time and resources elsewhere and leave it to the people themselves to take whatever steps are needed to preserve their own distinct languages."

    "question": "Although many people think that the luxuries and conveniences of contemporary life are entirely harmless, they, in fact, prevent people from developing into truly strong and independent individuals.",
    "answer": "Do modern luxuries serve to undermine our true strength and independence as individuals? The speaker believes so, and I tend to agree. Consider the automobile, for example. Most people consider the automobile a necessity rather than a luxury; yet it is for this very reason that the automobile so aptly supports the speaker's point. To the extent that we depend on cars as crutches, they prevent us from becoming truly independent and strong in character as individuals.\n\nConsider first the effect of the automobile on our independence as individuals. In some respects, the automobile serves to enhance such independence. For example, cars make it possible for people in isolated and depressed areas without public transportation to become more independent by pursuing gainful employment outside their communities. And teenagers discover that owning a car, or even borrowing one on occasion, affords them a needed sense of independence from their parents.\n\nHowever, cars have diminished our independence in a number of more significant respects. We've grown dependent on our cars for commuting to work. We rely on them like crutches for short trips to the corner store and for carting our children to and from school. Moreover, the car has become a means not only to our assorted physical destinations but also to the attainment of our socioeconomic goals, insofar as the automobile has become a symbol of status. In fact, in my observation, many, if not most, working professionals willingly undermine their financial security for the sake of being seen driving this year's new SUV or luxury sedan. In short, we've become slaves to the automobile.\n\nConsider next the overall impact of the automobile on our strength as individuals, by which I mean strength of character, or mettle. I would be hard-pressed to list one way in which the automobile enhances one's strength of character. Driving a powerful SUV might afford a person a feeling and appearance of strength, or machismo. But this feeling has nothing to do with a person's true character.\n\nIn contrast, there is a certain strength of character that comes with eschewing modern conveniences such as cars, and with the knowledge that one is contributing to a cleaner and quieter environment, a safer neighborhood, and arguably a more genteel society. Also, alternative modes of transportation such as bicycling and walking are forms of exercise that require and promote the virtue of self-discipline. Finally, in my observation, people who have forsaken the automobile spend more time at home, where they are more inclined to prepare and even grow their own food and to spend more time with their families. The former enhances one's independence; the latter enhances the integrity of one's values and the strength of one's family.\n\nTo sum up, the automobile helps illustrate that when a luxury becomes a necessity, it can sap our independence and strength as individuals. Perhaps our society is better off, on balance, with such 'luxuries'; after all, the automobile industry has created countless jobs, raised our standard of living, and made the world more interesting. However, by becoming slaves to the automobile, we trade off a certain independence and inner strength."

    "question": "Most cultures encourage individuals to sacrifice a large part of their own personalities in order to be like other people. Thus, most people are afraid to think or behave differently because they do not want to be excluded.",
    "answer": "The speaker claims that most cultures encourage conformity at the expense of individuality, and as a result, most people conform for fear of being excluded. While I find the second prong of this dual claim well supported overall by empirical evidence, I take exception with the first prong; aside from the cultures created by certain oppressive political regimes, no culture need 'encourage' its members to conform to prevailing ways of thought and behavior; in fact, all the evidence shows that cultures attempt to do just the opposite.\n\nAs a threshold matter, it is necessary to distinguish between conformity that an oppressive ruling state imposes on its own culture and conformity in a free democratic society. In the former case, people are not only encouraged but actually coerced into suppressing individual personality; and indeed, these people are afraid to think and behave differently—but not for fear of being excluded but rather for fear of punishment and persecution by the state. The modern Communist and Fascist regimes are fitting examples. With respect to free democratic societies, it might be tempting to dismiss the speaker's dual claim out of hand. After all, true democratic states are predicated on individual freedoms—of choice, speech, expression, religion, and so forth. Ostensibly, these freedoms serve to promote individuality, even non-conformity, in our personas, our lifestyles, and our opinions and attitudes.\n\nYet, one look at any democratic society reveals a high degree of conformity among its members. Every society has its own bundle of values, customs, and mores, which most of its members share. Admittedly, within any culture springs up various subcultures that try to distinguish themselves by their own distinct values, customs, and mores. In the U.S., for instance, African-Americans have developed a distinct dialect, known as Ebonics, and a distinct body language and attitude that affords them a strong sub-cultural identity of their own. Yet, the undeniable fact is that humans, given the actual freedom to either conform or not conform, choose to think and behave in ways similar to most people in their social group—however we define that group.\n\nNor is there much empirical evidence of any cultural agenda, either overt or covert, to encourage conformity in thought and behavior among the members of any culture. To the contrary, the predominant message in most cultures is that people should cultivate their individuality. Consider, for example, the enduring and nearly ubiquitous icon of the rugged individualist, who charts his or her own course, bucks the trend, and achieves notoriety through individual creativity, imagination, invention, or entrepreneurship. Even our systems of higher education seem to encourage individualism by promoting and cultivating critical and independent thought among its students.\n\nYet, all the support for forging one's own unique persona, career, lifestyle, opinions, and even belief system turns out to be hype. In the final analysis, most people choose to conform. And understandably so; after all, it is human nature to distrust, and even shun, others who are too different from us. Thus, to embrace rugged individualism is to risk becoming an outcast, the natural consequence of which is to limit one's socioeconomic and career opportunities. This prospect suffices to quell our yearning to be different; thus, the speaker is correct that most of us resign ourselves to conformity for fear of being left behind by our peers. Admittedly, few cultures are without rugged individualists—the exceptional artists, inventors, explorers, social reformers, and entrepreneurs who embrace their autonomy of thought and behavior, then test their limits. And paradoxically, it is the achievements of these notable non-conformists that are responsible for most cultural evolution and progress. Yet such notables are few and far between in what is otherwise a world of insecure, even fearful, cultural conformists.\n\nTo sum up, the speaker is correct that most people choose to conform rather than behave and think in ways that run contrary to their culture's norms, and that fear of being excluded lies at the heart of this choice. Yet, no culture need encourage conformity; most humans recognize that there is safety in numbers, and as a result, freely choose conformity over the risks, and potential rewards, of non-conformity."

    "question": "There are two types of laws: just and unjust. Every individual in a society has a responsibility to obey just laws and, even more importantly, to disobey and resist unjust laws.",
    "answer": "According to this statement, each person has a duty to not only obey just laws but also disobey unjust ones. In my view, this statement is too extreme, in two respects. First, it wrongly categorizes any law as either just or unjust; and secondly, it recommends an ineffective and potentially harmful means of legal reform.\n\nFirst, whether a law is just or unjust is rarely a straightforward issue. The fairness of any law depends on one's personal value system. This is especially true when it comes to personal freedoms. Consider, for example, the controversial issue of abortion. Individuals with particular religious beliefs tend to view laws allowing mothers an abortion choice as unjust, while individuals with other value systems might view such laws as just.\n\nThe fairness of a law also depends on one's personal interest, or stake, in the legal issue at hand. After all, in a democratic society, the chief function of laws is to strike a balance among competing interests. Consider, for example, a law that regulates the toxic effluents a certain factory can emit into a nearby river. Such laws are designed chiefly to protect public health. But complying with the regulation might be costly for the company; the factory might be forced to lay off employees or shut down altogether, or increase the price of its products to compensate for the cost of compliance. At stake are the respective interests of the company's owners, employees, and customers, as well as the opposing interests of the region's residents whose health and safety are impacted. In short, the fairness of the law is subjective, depending largely on how one's personal interests are affected by it.\n\nThe second fundamental problem with the statement is that disobeying unjust laws often has the opposite effect of what was intended or hoped for. Most anyone would argue, for instance, that our federal system of income taxation is unfair in one respect or another. Yet the end result of widespread disobedience, in this case, tax evasion, is to perpetuate the system. Free-riders only compel the government to maintain tax rates at high levels in order to ensure adequate revenue for the various programs in its budget.\n\nYet another fundamental problem with the statement is that by justifying a violation of one sort of law, we find ourselves on a slippery slope toward sanctioning all types of illegal behavior, including egregious criminal conduct. Returning to the abortion example mentioned above, a person strongly opposed to the freedom-of-choice position might maintain that the illegal blocking of access to an abortion clinic amounts to justifiable disobedience. However, it is a precariously short leap from this sort of civil disobedience to physical confrontations with clinic workers, then to the infliction of property damage, then to the bombing of the clinic and potential murder.\n\nIn sum, because the inherent function of our laws is to balance competing interests, reasonable people with different priorities will always disagree about the fairness of specific laws. Accordingly, radical action such as resistance or disobedience is rarely justified merely by one's subjective viewpoint or personal interests. And in any event, disobedience is never justifiable when the legal rights or safety of innocent people are jeopardized as a result."

    "question": "Anyone can make things bigger and more complex. What requires real effort and courage is to move in the opposite direction—in other words, to make things as simple as possible.",
    "answer": "Whether making things simple requires greater effort and courage than making them bigger and more complex depends on the sort of effort and courage. Indisputably, the many complex technological marvels that are part-and-parcel of our lives today are the result of the extraordinary cumulative efforts of our engineers, entrepreneurs, and others. And such achievements always call for the courage to risk failing in a large way. Yet, humans seem naturally driven to make things bigger and more complex; thus refraining from doing so, or reversing this natural process, takes considerable effort and courage of a different sort, as discussed below.\n\nThe statement brings immediately to mind the ever-growing and increasingly complex digital world. Today's high-tech firms seem compelled to boldly go to whatever effort is required to devise increasingly complex products, for the ostensible purpose of staying ahead of their competitors. Yet, the sort of effort and courage to which the statement refers is a different one—bred of vision, imagination, and a willingness to forego near-term profits for the prospect of making lasting contributions. Surely, a number of entrepreneurs and engineers today are mustering that courage and are making the effort to create far simpler, yet more elegant, technologies and applications, which will truly make our lives simpler in sharp contrast to what computer technology has delivered to us so far.\n\nLending even more credence to the statement is the so-called 'big government' phenomenon. Human societies have a natural tendency to create unwieldy bureaucracies, a fitting example of which is the U.S. tax-law system. The Internal Revenue Code and its accompanying Treasury Regulations have grown so voluminous and complex that many certified accountants and tax attorneys admit that they cannot begin to understand it all. Admittedly, this system has grown only through considerable effort on the part of all three branches of the federal government, not to mention the efforts of many special interest groups. Yet, therein lies the statement's credibility. It requires great effort and courage on the part of a legislator to risk alienating special interest groups, thereby risking reelection prospects, by standing on principle for a simpler tax system that is less costly to administer and better serves the interests of most taxpayers.\n\nAdding further credibility to the statement is the tendency of most people to complicate their personal lives—a tendency that seems especially strong in today's age of technology and consumerism. The greater our mobility, the greater our number of destinations each day; the more time-saving gadgets we use, the more activities we try to pack into our day; and with readier access to information, we try to assimilate more of it each day. I am hard-pressed to think of one person who has ever exclaimed to me how much effort and courage it has taken to complicate his or her life in these respects. In contrast, a certain self-restraint and courage of conviction are both required to eschew modern conveniences, to simplify one's daily schedule, and to establish and adhere to a simple plan for the use of one's time and money.\n\nIn sum, whether we are building computer networks, government agencies, or personal lifestyles, great effort and courage are required to make things simple, or to keep them that way. Moreover, because humans naturally tend to make things big and complex, it arguably requires more effort and courage to move in the opposite direction. In the final analysis, making things simple—or keeping them that way—takes a brand of effort born of reflection and restraint rather than sheer exertion, and a courage of character and conviction rather than unbridled ambition."

    "question": "Most people would agree that buildings represent a valuable record of any society's past, but controversy arises when old buildings stand on ground that modern planners feel could be better used for modern purposes. In such situations, modern development should be given precedence over the preservation of historic buildings so that contemporary needs can be served.",
    "answer": "The speaker asserts that wherever a practical, utilitarian need for new buildings arises this need should take precedence over our conflicting interest in preserving historic buildings as a record of our past. In my view, however, which interest should take precedence should be determined on a case-by-case basis--and should account not only for practical and historic considerations but also aesthetic ones.\n\nIn determining whether to raze an older building, planners should of course consider the community's current and anticipated utilitarian needs. For example, if an additional hospital is needed to adequately serve the health-care needs of a fast-growing community, this compelling interest might very well outweigh any interest in preserving a historic building that sits on the proposed site. Or if additional parking is needed to ensure the economic survival of a city's downtown district, this interest might take precedence over the historic value of an old structure that stands in the way of a parking structure. On the other hand, if the need is mainly for more office space, in some cases an architecturally appropriate add-on or annex to an older building might serve just as well as razing the old building to make way for a new one. Of course, an expensive retrofit might not be worthwhile if no amount of retrofitting would meet the need.\n\nCompeting with a community's utilitarian needs is an interest preserving the historical record. Again, the weight of this interest should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Perhaps an older building uniquely represents a bygone era, or once played a central role in the city's history as a municipal structure. Or perhaps the building once served as the home of a founding family or other significant historical figure, or as the location of an important historical event. Any of these scenarios might justify saving the building at the expense of the practical needs of the community. On the other hand, if several older buildings represent the same historical era just as effectively, or if the building's history is an unremarkable one, then the historic value of the building might pale in comparison to the value of a new structure that meets a compelling practical need.\n\nAlso competing with a community's utilitarian needs is the aesthetic and architectural value of the building itself--apart from historical events with which it might be associated. A building might be one of only a few that represents a certain architectural style. Or it might be especially beautiful, perhaps as a result of the craftsmanship and materials employed in its construction--which might be cost-prohibitive to replicate today. Even retrofitting the building to accommodate current needs might undermine its aesthetic as well as historic value, by altering its appearance and architectural integrity. Of course it is difficult to quantify aesthetic value and weigh it against utilitarian considerations. Yet planners should strive to account for aesthetic value nonetheless.\n\nIn sum, whether to raze an older building in order to construct a new one should never be determined indiscriminately. Instead, planners should make such decisions on a case-by-case basis, weighing the community's practical needs against the building's historic and aesthetic value."

    "question": "Students should memorize facts only after they have studied the ideas, trends, and concepts that help explain those facts. Students who have learned only facts have learned very little.",
    "answer": "The speaker makes a threshold claim that students who learn only facts learn very little, then concludes that students should always learn about concepts, ideas, and trends before they memorize facts. While I wholeheartedly agree with the threshold claim, the conclusion unfairly generalizes about the learning process. In fact, following the speaker's advice would actually impede the learning of concepts and ideas, as well as impeding the development of insightful and useful new ones.\n\nTurning first to the speaker's threshold claim, I strongly agree that if we learn only facts we learn very little. Consider the task of memorizing the periodic table of elements, which any student can memorize without any knowledge of chemistry, or that the table relates to chemistry. Rote memorization of the table amounts to a bit of mental exercise—an opportunity to practice memorization techniques and perhaps learn some new ones. Otherwise, the student has learned very little about chemical elements, or about anything for that matter.\n\nAs for the speaker's ultimate claim, I concede that postponing the memorization of facts until after one learns ideas and concepts holds certain advantages. With a conceptual framework already in place a student is better able to understand the meaning of a fact, and to appreciate its significance. As a result, the student is more likely to memorize the fact to begin with, and less likely to forget it as time passes. Moreover, in my observation students whose first goal is to memorize facts tend to stop there—for whatever reason. It seems that by focusing on facts first students risk equating the learning process with the assimilation of trivia; in turn, students risk learning nothing of much use in solving real-world problems.\n\nConceding that students must learn ideas and concepts, as well as facts relating to them, in order to learning anything meaningful, I nevertheless disagree that the former should always precede the latter—for three reasons. In the first place, I see no reason why memorizing a fact cannot precede learning about its meaning and significance—as long as the student does not stop at rote memorization. Consider once again our hypothetical chemistry student. The speaker might advise this student to first learn about the historical trends leading to the discovery of the elements, or to learn about the concepts of altering chemical compounds to achieve certain reactions—before studying the periodic table. Having no familiarity with the basic vocabulary of chemistry, which includes the information in the periodic table, this student would come away from the first two lessons bewildered and confused—in other words, having learned little.\n\nIn sum, in a vacuum facts are meaningless, and only by filling that vacuum with ideas and concepts can students learn, by gaining useful perspectives and insights about facts. Yet, since facts are the very stuff from which ideas, concepts, and trends spring, without some facts students cannot learn much of anything. In the final analysis, then, students should learn facts right along with concepts, ideas, and trends."

    "question": "The media tend to highlight what is sensational at the moment. Society would be better served if the media reported or focused more fully on events and trends that will ultimately have the most long-term significance.",
    "answer": "The speaker asserts that rather than merely highlighting certain sensational events, the media should provide complete coverage of more important events. While the speaker’s assertion has merit from a normative standpoint, in the final analysis, I find this assertion indefensible.\n\nUpon first impression, the speaker’s claim seems quite compelling, for two reasons. First, without the benefit of a complete, unfiltered, and balanced account of current events, it is impossible to develop an informed and intelligent opinion about important social and political issues and, in turn, to contribute meaningfully to our democratic society, which relies on broad participation in an ongoing debate about such issues to steer a proper course. The end result of our being a largely uninformed people is that we relegate the most important decisions to a handful of legislators, jurists, and executives who may or may not know what is best for us.\n\nSecond, by focusing on the ‘sensational’—by which I take the speaker to mean comparatively shocking, entertaining, and titillating events which easily catch one’s attention—the media appeal to our emotions and baser instincts, rather than to our intellect and reason. Any observant person could list many examples aptly illustrating the trend in this direction—from trashy talk shows and local news broadcasts to sensationalized tabloids. This trend clearly serves to undermine a society’s collective sensibilities and renders its members more vulnerable to demagoguery.\n\nHowever, for several reasons, I find the media’s current trend toward highlights and the sensational to be justifiable. First, the world is becoming an increasingly eventful place; thus, with each passing year, it becomes a more onerous task for the media to attempt full news coverage. Second, we are becoming an increasingly busy society. The average worker today spends more time working than ever before, leaving little time for extensive news consumption. Thus, brief summaries must suffice. Third, the media does in fact provide full coverage of important events; anyone can find such coverage beyond newspaper headlines, on daily news programs, and on the Internet.\n\nOn balance, the speaker’s claim is not defensible. The media serve their proper function by merely providing what we in a free society demand. Thus, any argument about how the media should or should not behave—regardless of its merits—begs the question."

    "question": "Public figures such as actors, politicians, and athletes should expect people to be interested in their private lives. When they seek a public role, they should expect that they will lose at least some of their privacy.",
    "answer": "This statement is fundamentally correct; public figures should indeed expect to lose their privacy. After all, we are a society of voyeurs wishing to transform our mundane lives; and one way to do so is to live vicariously through the experiences of others whose lives appear more interesting than our own. Moreover, the media recognize this societal tendency and exploit it at every opportunity. Nevertheless, a more accurate statement would draw a distinction between political figures and other public figures; the former have even less reason than the latter to expect to be left alone, for the reason that their duty as public servants legitimizes public scrutiny of their private lives.\n\nThe chief reason why I generally agree with the statement is that, for better or worse, intense media attention to the lives of public figures raises a presumption in the collective mind of the public that these figures’ lives are far more interesting than our own. This presumption is understandable. Given the opportunity for even fleeting fame, most people would embrace it without hesitation. Peering into the private lives of those who have achieved our dreams allows us to live vicariously through those lives.\n\nAnother reason why I generally agree with the statement has to do with the forces that motivate the media. For the most part, the media consist of large corporations whose chief objective is to maximize shareholder profits. In pursuit of that objective, the media simply give the public what they demand—a voyeuristic look into the private lives of public figures.\n\nNevertheless, the statement should be qualified in that a political figure has less reason to expect privacy than other public figures. Why? The private affairs of public servants become our business when those affairs adversely affect their ability to serve us effectively or when they betray our trust. For example, consider a university chancellor expelled from office for misusing university funds to renovate his personal residence. The scandal became front-page news, prompting useful system-wide reforms. Also, consider political sex scandals, which often result in legal proceedings and debates about executive privilege and public accountability.\n\nIn sum, intense public scrutiny of the personal lives of public figures can carry harmful consequences for the public figure as well as society. Yet, until we, as a society, appreciate the potentially harmful effects of our preoccupation with their lives, public figures can expect to remain the center of our attention."

    "question": "The primary goal of technological advancement should be to increase people's efficiency so that everyone has more leisure time.",
    "answer": "The speaker contends that technology’s primary goal should be to increase our efficiency for the purpose of affording us more leisure time. I concede that technology has enhanced our efficiency as we go about our everyday lives. Productivity software helps us plan and coordinate projects; the internet and satellite technology make us more efficient communicators; and technology even helps us prepare our food and access entertainment more efficiently. Beyond this concession, however, I find the speaker’s contention indefensible from both an empirical and a normative standpoint.\n\nThe chief reason for my disagreement lies in empirical proof: with technological advancement comes diminished leisure time. In 1960, the average worker spent just over 40 hours per week at work. Since then, the average workweek has increased, and in most families, both spouses work. What explains this decline in leisure despite increasing efficiency? Technology itself is the culprit. As technology enables greater productivity, employers' expectations for production also rise. Further technological advances breed still greater efficiency and, in turn, greater work demands. Moreover, every technological advance demands our time and attention to learn how to use it. Time devoted to keeping pace with technology depletes time for leisure activities.\n\nI disagree with the speaker for another reason as well: the suggestion that technology’s chief goal should be to facilitate leisure is misguided. There are far more vital concerns that technology can and should address. Advances in biotechnology can help cure and prevent diseases; advances in medical technology can allow for safer, less invasive diagnoses and treatments; advances in genetics can help prevent birth defects; advances in engineering can improve the structural integrity of buildings, roads, and bridges. In short, health, safety, education, and freedom—not leisure—are the proper final objectives of technology.\n\nIn sum, I find the speaker’s suggestion that technology’s value lies chiefly in the efficiency and resulting leisure time it can afford us to be indefensible. The suggestion runs contrary to overwhelming evidence that technology diminishes leisure time, and it wrongly places leisure ahead of goals such as health, safety, and education as technology’s ultimate aims."

    "question": "Money spent on research is almost always a good investment, even when the results of that research are controversial.",
    "answer": "I agree with the speaker’s broad assertion that money spent on research is generally money well invested. However, the speaker unnecessarily extends this broad assertion to embrace research whose results are 'controversial,' while ignoring certain compelling reasons why some types of research might be unjustifiable.\n\nI concede that the speaker is on the correct philosophical side of this issue. After all, research is the exploration of the unknown for true answers to our questions, and for lasting solutions to our enduring problems. Research is also the chief means by which we humans attempt to satisfy our insatiable appetite for knowledge and our craving to understand ourselves and the world around us.\n\nWhile we must invest in research irrespective of whether the results might be controversial, at the same time we should be cautious about research whose objectives are too vague or whose potential benefits are too speculative. After all, expensive research always carries significant opportunity costs—resources that could otherwise be used to address pressing social problems. One example involves the so-called 'Star Wars' defense initiative, championed by the Reagan administration in the 1980s. This initiative was largely a waste of taxpayer dollars, and in retrospect, the funds could have been better spent on addressing pressing social issues such as education, healthcare, and crime prevention.\n\nThe speaker’s assertion is troubling in two other respects as well. First, no amount of research can completely solve the enduring problems of war, poverty, and violence, as these stem from certain aspects of human nature such as aggression and greed. Second, while some scientific breakthroughs help reduce suffering, others serve to add to it. For example, while nuclear physics has provided alternative energy sources, it has also led to nuclear weapons.\n\nIn sum, while money spent on research is generally a sound investment, we must also consider the costs and consequences of research. Investing in research without clear aims or ethical considerations risks squandering resources that could have been used to address immediate societal concerns."

    "question": "Creating an appealing image has become more important in contemporary society than is the reality or truth behind that image.",
    "answer": "Has creating an image become more important in our society than the reality or truth behind the image? I agree that image has become a more central concern, at least where short-term business or political success is at stake. Nevertheless, I think that in the longer term, image ultimately yields to substance and fact.\n\nThe important role of image is particularly evident in the business world. Consider, for example, today’s automobile industry. American cars are becoming essentially identical to competing Japanese cars in nearly every mechanical and structural respect, as well as in price. Thus, to compete effectively, auto companies must now differentiate their products largely through image advertising, by conjuring up certain illusory benefits—such as machismo, status, or practicality. The increasing focus on image is also evident in the music industry, where originality, artistic interpretation, and technical proficiency have yielded almost entirely to sex appeal and mass-market trends.\n\nThe growing significance of image is also evident in the political realm, particularly in presidential politics. Since the advent of television, image has become even more central in elections. For example, it was television that arguably helped elect John F. Kennedy over Richard Nixon. Moreover, modern elections often hinge on how a candidate presents themselves rather than on their policies or abilities.\n\nHowever, in the long term, the significance of image wanes considerably. The image of the Marlboro man ultimately gave way to the truth about the health hazards of cigarette smoking. Popular musical acts with no real innovation eventually disappear. Even in politics, history has a knack for peeling away image to focus on real accomplishments. Thus, while image is often crucial in the short term, truth and substance ultimately prevail.\n\nIn sum, in every endeavor where success depends on persuasion, marketing, or salesmanship, image plays a central role. However, as time passes, truth and substance become more important, ensuring that only those with real value and impact endure."

    "question": "Most of the people we consider heroic today were, in fact, very ordinary people who happened to be in the right place at the right time.",
    "answer": "I agree with the statement insofar as our heroes tend to be ordinary people like us. However, I strongly disagree with the further assertion that people become heroes simply by being 'in the right place at the right time.' If we examine the sorts of people we choose as our heroes, we realize that heroism has far less to do with circumstance than with how a hero responds to it.\n\nI concede that heroes are generally ordinary people. In my observation, we choose as our heroes people with whom we strongly identify—people who are very much like us. Many of us call a parent, grandparent, or older sibling our hero. The more a person shares in common with us, the more accessible their heroic traits become to us.\n\nHowever, the statement’s further suggestion that people become heroes merely as a result of circumstances not of their own choosing is incorrect. Admittedly, circumstance often serves as a catalyst for heroism. Without wars, for example, there would be no war heroes. Yet this does not mean that every soldier is a hero. Heroism requires great effort, fortitude, or courage.\n\nConsider, for example, the ordinary person who overcomes a personal obstacle through extraordinary effort—thereby inspiring others. Sports heroes often fall into this category. Lance Armstrong, for instance, became a national hero not merely because he won the Tour de France but because he overcame life-threatening cancer to do so. Similarly, people with physical disabilities who push through challenges serve as role models.\n\nAnother kind of hero is the person who attains heroic stature by demonstrating extraordinary courage of conviction. Many such heroes are champions of social causes, such as Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela. These individuals did not simply happen to be in the right place at the right time; rather, they acted decisively in response to adversity.\n\nIn sum, while heroes often come from ordinary backgrounds, heroism itself is not accidental. It is defined by how an individual responds to adversity, not by chance circumstances."

    "question": "The greatness of individuals can be decided only by those who live after them, not by their contemporaries.",
    "answer": "Can a person’s greatness be recognized only in retrospect, by those who live after the person, as the speaker maintains? In my view, the speaker unfairly generalizes. In some areas, especially the arts, greatness is often recognizable in its nascent stages. However, in other areas, particularly the physical sciences, greatness must be tested over time before it can be confirmed. In still other areas, such as business, the incubation period for greatness varies from case to case.\n\nWe do not require a rear-view mirror to recognize artistic greatness—whether in music, visual arts, or literature. The reason for this is simple: art can be judged at face value. There is nothing to be later proved or disproved, affirmed or discredited, or even improved upon or refined by further knowledge or newer technology. History is replete with examples of artistic greatness immediately recognized, then later confirmed. Michelangelo’s artistic brilliance was acknowledged in his own time, as was Mozart’s musical genius. Likewise, Mark Twain became a best-selling author and household name even during his lifetime.\n\nBy contrast, in the sciences, it is difficult to identify greatness without the benefit of historical perspective. Any scientific theory might be disproved tomorrow, thereby demoting the theorist’s contribution to the status of a historical footnote. Or the theory might withstand centuries of rigorous scientific scrutiny and serve as a springboard for later advances. For example, the significance of Einstein’s relativity theory could only be tested and confirmed over time, with experimental evidence that emerged decades after he formulated it.\n\nIn the realm of business, in some cases great achievement is recognizable immediately, while in other cases it is not. Henry Ford’s assembly-line approach to manufacturing cars for the masses was clearly a revolutionary contribution, though its full impact took time to unfold. Meanwhile, figures like Bill Gates were recognized as transformative leaders in their industry while they were still actively shaping it.\n\nIn sum, the speaker overlooks many great individuals, particularly in the arts and in business, whose achievements were broadly recognized as great even during their own time. Nevertheless, other great achievements, especially scientific ones, cannot be confirmed as such without the benefit of historical perspective."

    "question": "In the age of television, reading books is not as important as it once was. People can learn as much by watching television as they can by reading books.",
    "answer": "The speaker contends that people learn just as much from watching television as by reading books, and therefore that reading books is not as important for learning as it once was. I strongly disagree. I concede that in a few respects, television, including video, can be a more efficient and effective means of learning. In most respects, however, these newer media serve as poor substitutes for books when it comes to learning.\n\nAdmittedly, television holds certain advantages over books for imparting certain types of knowledge. For the purpose of documenting and conveying temporal and spatial events and experiences, film and video generally provide a more accurate and convincing record than a book or other written account. For example, it is impossible for anyone, no matter how keen an observer and skilled a journalist, to recount in complete and objective detail events such as a ballet performance or a natural disaster. Television captures such moments more effectively.\n\nHowever, the speaker overlooks several respects in which books are inherently superior to television as a medium for learning. Watching television or a video is no indication that any significant learning is taking place; the comparatively passive nature of these media can render them ineffectual in the learning process. Also, books are far more portable than television sets. Moreover, books do not break, do not require electricity, and allow for deep reflection and review.\n\nThe speaker also ignores the tendency of television media to filter information in order to appeal to the widest audience, often at the expense of depth and accuracy. The result is that viewers do not receive complete, unfiltered, and balanced information, and therefore cannot rely on television to develop informed and intelligent opinions about important social and political issues.\n\nA final argument in favor of books is that they facilitate serendipitous learning. Browsing through a library or bookstore often leads to unexpected discoveries. In contrast, television presents content in a linear format, limiting spontaneous exploration.\n\nIn sum, while television can complement books in some areas, books remain the superior medium for in-depth learning and intellectual engagement. In the final analysis, the optimal approach is to use both media side by side—television for staying informed and books for deeper understanding."

    "question": "Scholars and researchers should not be concerned with whether their work makes a contribution to the larger society. It is more important that they pursue their individual interests, however unusual or idiosyncratic those interests may seem.",
    "answer": "Should academic scholars and researchers be free to pursue whatever avenues of inquiry and research interest them, no matter how unusual or idiosyncratic, as the speaker asserts? Or should they strive instead to focus on those areas that are most likely to benefit society? I strongly agree with the speaker, for three reasons.\n\nFirst of all, who is to decide which areas of academic inquiry are worthwhile? Scholars cannot be left to decide. Given a choice, they will pursue their own idiosyncratic areas of interest, and it is unlikely that all scholars could reach a consensus on what research areas would be most beneficial. Nor can these decisions be left to regulators and legislators, who would bring their own biases and political influences to bear.\n\nSecondly, by human nature, we are motivated to pursue activities in which we excel. To compel scholars to focus only on certain areas would be to force many to waste their true talents. For example, imagine relegating a preeminent astrophysicist to research the effectiveness of social welfare programs. Such an approach would be counterproductive.\n\nThirdly, it is precisely 'idiosyncratic' and 'unusual' avenues of inquiry that lead to the greatest contributions to society. Many of the most groundbreaking scientific discoveries were initially seen as strange or impractical. History is filled with examples of unconventional ideas that later proved transformative, such as quantum physics, relativity theory, and even the idea that the Earth orbits the Sun.\n\nThose who oppose the speaker’s assertion might argue that publicly funded universities should not allow scholars to indulge their personal intellectual fantasies at taxpayer expense. However, as long as universities maintain strict peer review and research standards, frivolous research cannot persist for long. Furthermore, the humanities and the arts, though not always directly applicable, enrich society in immeasurable ways.\n\nIn sum, I agree that academic scholars should have nearly unfettered freedom to pursue intellectual inquiry within reasonable limits as determined by peer review. Unconstrained research often leads to the most profound discoveries, and by fostering an environment of academic curiosity, we ensure the continued advancement of human knowledge."

    "question": "Such nonmainstream areas of inquiry as astrology, fortune-telling, and psychic and paranormal pursuits play a vital role in society by satisfying human needs that are not addressed by mainstream science.",
    "answer": "This statement actually consists of two claims: (1) that non-mainstream areas of inquiry are vital in satisfying human needs, and (2) that these areas are therefore vital to society. I concede that astrology, fortune-telling, and psychic and paranormal pursuits respond to certain basic human needs. However, in my view, the potential harm they can inflict on their participants and on society far outweighs their psychological benefits.\n\nAdmittedly, these non-mainstream areas of inquiry address certain human needs that mainstream science and other areas of intellectual inquiry inherently cannot. One such need involves our common experience as humans that we make our own choices and decisions in life and therefore carry some responsibility for their consequences. To avoid the uncertainty, insecurity, and regret that come with making difficult choices, many people seek guidance from astrology or tarot cards.\n\nAnother human need satisfied by these pursuits relates to our awareness of mortality. This awareness causes existential anxiety, and many people attempt to find comfort in the idea of an afterlife through paranormal and psychic pursuits. Others seek connection with extraterrestrial beings or past lives as a means of feeling more significant in the universe.\n\nWhile these pursuits may offer psychological comfort, they can also be detrimental. Because they are not rooted in reason, they are often exploited by frauds and charlatans who prey on the vulnerable. Furthermore, those who engage in these pursuits may become detached from reality, relying on superstitions rather than rational decision-making. In extreme cases, such beliefs have fueled mass hysteria, cult behavior, and harmful pseudoscientific movements.\n\nIn sum, while these non-mainstream pursuits provide psychological relief to some, they are ultimately more harmful than beneficial. Encouraging scientific literacy and critical thinking serves society far better than indulging in mystical and unverified beliefs."

    "question": "To be an effective leader, a public official must maintain the highest ethical and moral standards.",
    "answer": "Whether successful leadership requires that a leader follow high ethical and moral standards is a complex issue—one that is fraught with problems of defining ethics, morality, and successful leadership. In addressing the issue, it is helpful to consider three distinct forms of leadership: business, political, and social-spiritual.\n\nIn the business realm, successful leadership is generally defined as achieving the goal of profit maximization for a firm's shareholders. Many argue that this is a business leader’s highest moral obligation. However, others claim that business leaders also have ethical responsibilities to consumers, employees, and society at large, such as providing safe products and ensuring environmental sustainability. In my view, in today’s era of increased corporate scrutiny, business leaders who uphold ethical standards tend to achieve long-term success, while unethical ones ultimately face public backlash.\n\nIn politics, the issue is even more nuanced. Distinguishing between personal morality and public morality is key. Many politicians have been successful despite personal moral failings, such as marital indiscretions. However, when public morality is compromised—such as in cases of corruption or abuse of power—leaders often face consequences. History has shown that leaders who disregard public trust, like Richard Nixon, ultimately fail.\n\nIn social and spiritual leadership, morality and ethics are paramount. Figures such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Mother Teresa derived their influence from their unwavering commitment to moral principles. Unlike business or political leaders, social-spiritual leaders must embody the ethics they promote to inspire and maintain their following.\n\nIn sum, while high ethical and moral standards are not always required for leadership in business or politics, they are crucial for social-spiritual leadership. Nevertheless, in all fields, unethical behavior can have long-term consequences that erode a leader’s credibility and effectiveness."

    "question": "While some leaders in government, sports, industry, and other areas attribute their success to a well-developed sense of competition, a society can better prepare its young people for leadership by instilling in them a sense of cooperation.",
    "answer": "Which is a better way to prepare young people for leadership: developing a spirit of competitiveness or one of cooperation? The speaker favors cooperation, even though some leaders attribute their success to a competitive spirit. I tend to agree with the speaker, for reasons related to our increasingly interconnected world and the nature of effective leadership.\n\nThe chief reason why we should stress cooperation in nurturing young people today is that, as tomorrow’s leaders, they will face pressing societal problems that cannot be solved without international cooperation. Issues such as climate change, global health crises, and economic stability require collaborative efforts between nations and organizations.\n\nA second reason is that effective leadership depends less on competition than on the ability to work with others. Leaders who value cooperation foster teamwork, trust, and shared goals. In contrast, those who focus solely on competition may alienate subordinates and create adversarial environments.\n\nMoreover, instilling cooperation encourages leaders to focus on innovative solutions rather than merely outperforming others. Many business and political challenges require partnerships, alliances, and compromises rather than cutthroat rivalries.\n\nThat being said, competition does have its place. A thriving economy depends on a competitive business environment that drives innovation and efficiency. However, competition and cooperation are not mutually exclusive. The most effective leaders balance both, recognizing when to compete and when to collaborate.\n\nIn sum, while competition plays an important role in certain contexts, fostering a cooperative mindset in young leaders is more beneficial for addressing the world’s most pressing challenges and ensuring long-term success."

    "question": "Society does not place enough emphasis on the intellect—that is, on reasoning and other cognitive skills.",
    "answer": "The speaker asserts that society should place more emphasis on intellect and cognition. While the speaker might overlook the benefits of nurturing certain emotions and feelings, on balance, I agree that it is by way of our intellect rather than our emotions that we can best ensure the well-being of society.\n\nI concede that an excessive focus on intellectual development at the expense of emotional well-being can be harmful. Suppressing emotions can lead to depression, dysfunction, and even physical illness. Additionally, fostering compassion and empathy has clear societal benefits, such as promoting cooperation and reducing conflict.\n\nHowever, overemphasizing emotions and de-emphasizing intellect can carry even more dangerous consequences for society. Without rational thought and critical reasoning, societies can become susceptible to manipulation, propaganda, and even violence. History provides numerous examples where emotional appeals have led to destructive ideologies, from demagogues exploiting fear to extremist movements fueled by unchecked emotions.\n\nMoreover, the prevalence of sensationalist media and reality television suggests that contemporary society often prioritizes entertainment over intellectual discourse. This cultural shift undermines rational debate and informed decision-making, contributing to societal polarization and misinformation.\n\nIn sum, while emotions play an important role in human interactions, they should not come at the expense of intellect. Reason, critical thinking, and cognitive skills are essential to personal success and the stability of society. Therefore, I strongly agree that society should place greater emphasis on intellectual development."

    "question": "The study of history places too much emphasis on individuals. The most significant events and trends in history were made possible not by the famous few, but by groups of people whose identities have long been forgotten.",
    "answer": "The speaker claims that significant historical events and trends are made possible by groups of people rather than individuals, and that the study of history should emphasize the former instead of the latter. I tend to disagree with both aspects of this claim. Learning about key historical figures inspires us to achieve great things and provides clarity in understanding history’s cause-and-effect relationships.\n\nAdmittedly, there are cases where groups have played a pivotal role in shaping history. For example, the preservation of Western civilization after the fall of Rome was largely due to the collective efforts of Benedictine monks who safeguarded knowledge in their monasteries. Similarly, movements such as the civil rights movement or labor unions have been driven by collective action rather than singular leaders.\n\nHowever, history also shows that transformative events often originate from visionary individuals. Johannes Gutenberg’s invention of the printing press revolutionized the dissemination of knowledge. Scientific breakthroughs, such as those of Newton, Einstein, and Curie, were the results of individual genius. Likewise, political movements are frequently catalyzed by charismatic leaders, such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Nelson Mandela.\n\nIn sum, while groups undoubtedly play a role in historical change, individuals often provide the necessary vision and leadership. The study of history should acknowledge both, but it is the contributions of individuals that serve as the clearest markers of progress and inspiration."

    "question": "Imaginative works such as novels, plays, films, fairy tales, and legends present a more accurate and meaningful picture of human experience than do factual accounts. Because the creators of fiction shape and focus reality rather than report on it literally, their creations have a more lasting significance.",
    "answer": "Do imaginative works hold more lasting significance than factual accounts, as the speaker claims? While it may seem counterintuitive, I tend to agree with the speaker. Fiction, by shaping and focusing reality, often conveys deeper truths about the human experience that factual accounts cannot.\n\nFactual accounts, such as historical records or news reports, provide objective details about events but are often limited in their ability to capture the emotions, complexities, and broader meanings behind those events. For example, while history books document the events of World War II, novels like *Night* by Elie Wiesel provide a visceral and personal perspective on the Holocaust that factual accounts cannot.\n\nAdditionally, imaginative works are often more enduring than factual ones. Shakespeare’s plays, for instance, continue to be widely read and performed because they capture timeless themes of love, ambition, and betrayal. Similarly, George Orwell’s *1984* remains relevant today not because it is a literal account of history but because it encapsulates the dangers of totalitarianism in a way that resonates across generations.\n\nThat said, fiction is no substitute for fact. Scientific progress, political decisions, and legal judgments rely on factual accuracy. However, in terms of shaping cultural values and personal identity, imaginative works have a unique ability to provide meaning and perspective.\n\nIn sum, while factual accounts are necessary for documenting history, fiction often provides a deeper and more lasting understanding of the human condition. Thus, I agree that imaginative works are just as important, if not more so, in presenting an accurate and meaningful picture of human experience."

    "question": "In order to improve the quality of instruction at the college and university level, all faculty should be required to spend time working outside the academic world in professions relevant to the courses they teach.",
    "answer": "Whether college faculty should also work outside academia in professional roles relevant to their academic fields depends primarily on the subject area. For fields where practical experience enhances teaching, I strongly agree with the statement, as both students and faculty stand to gain in various ways.\n\nFirst, real-world experience allows professors to bring practical insights into the classroom, making theoretical concepts more tangible and engaging. Professors who actively participate in their fields can share contemporary challenges, industry trends, and case studies, enriching students' learning experience.\n\nSecond, faculty with professional experience can better guide students in career choices. They understand job market demands and can offer relevant advice about career paths, industry expectations, and skill development. This is particularly beneficial in fields such as business, engineering, and medicine, where real-world application is crucial.\n\nThird, faculty who work in their fields remain up to date with industry advancements, preventing their teaching from becoming outdated. This benefits research as well, as practical exposure can inspire new research directions and collaborations between academia and industry.\n\nHowever, the requirement should not apply universally. In some disciplines, such as literature, philosophy, and theoretical physics, practical work outside academia may not significantly enhance teaching. Additionally, requiring all faculty to work outside academia could divert time and energy away from research and mentoring.\n\nIn sum, while practical experience can greatly enhance teaching in certain fields, making it a universal requirement may not be necessary or beneficial. Universities should encourage faculty engagement with industry where relevant but allow flexibility based on the nature of the discipline."

    "question": "In any academic area or professional field, it is just as important to recognize the limits of our knowledge and understanding as it is to acquire new facts and information.",
    "answer": "Does recognizing the limits of our knowledge serve us as well as acquiring new facts and information? While our everyday experience supports this idea, it appears to contradict the fundamental principle of scientific progress. However, a deeper understanding reveals that both perspectives can be reconciled.\n\nOn the one hand, acknowledging the limits of our knowledge is crucial in fields such as medicine, law, and business, where decisions must account for uncertainty. Recognizing these limits allows professionals to act with caution, adapt to new developments, and seek further inquiry rather than assuming absolute certainty.\n\nAdditionally, recognizing our cognitive and informational limits helps prevent overconfidence and misinformation. In an era of rapid information flow, the ability to distinguish between what we know, what we assume, and what remains unknown is critical for sound decision-making and intellectual humility.\n\nOn the other hand, the pursuit of knowledge inherently requires challenging perceived limitations. Scientific breakthroughs occur when researchers push beyond what is assumed to be possible. If we were overly cautious about the limits of knowledge, scientific and technological advancements might stagnate.\n\nA balanced approach is ideal: We must recognize our intellectual boundaries while striving to expand them through continuous inquiry. By doing so, we encourage both humility and progress, ensuring that knowledge evolves while avoiding the dangers of intellectual arrogance.\n\nIn sum, recognizing the limits of knowledge is just as important as acquiring new information. A thoughtful approach that values both perspectives fosters intellectual curiosity while ensuring responsible decision-making."

    "question": "The concept of 'individual responsibility' is a necessary fiction. Although societies must hold individuals accountable for their own actions, people's behavior is largely determined by forces not of their own making.",
    "answer": "The speaker suggests that the concept of 'individual responsibility' is merely a necessary fiction, implying that external factors largely determine human behavior. While I acknowledge that social, economic, and genetic influences shape human actions, I fundamentally disagree with the idea that individual responsibility is fictional.\n\nFirst, without individual responsibility, the foundation of morality and justice collapses. Legal and ethical systems rely on the idea that people have agency over their actions. While external factors influence behavior, individuals still make choices and must be held accountable for them.\n\nSecond, free will and personal accountability play essential roles in personal development. People improve by recognizing their mistakes and making conscious efforts to change. If we attribute all actions to external forces, we risk undermining motivation, self-improvement, and personal growth.\n\nThat said, the speaker is correct in recognizing that external forces shape behavior. Socioeconomic background, education, and psychological factors all contribute to a person's decision-making process. A person born into poverty may have fewer opportunities than someone from a privileged background, but this does not mean they lack responsibility for their actions.\n\nIn sum, while it is true that external factors influence human behavior, the notion of individual responsibility is not merely a fiction—it is an essential principle for social order, morality, and personal growth. Recognizing both personal agency and external influences allows for a more nuanced and just perspective on human behavior."

    "question": "Universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the student's field of study because acquiring knowledge of various academic disciplines is the best way to become truly educated.",
    "answer": "I fundamentally agree with the proposition that students must take courses outside their major field of study to become 'truly educated.' A contrary position would reflect a too narrow view of higher education and its proper objectives. Nevertheless, I would caution that extending the proposition too far might risk undermining those objectives.\n\nThe primary reason why I agree with the proposition is that education amounts to far more than gaining the knowledge and ability to excel in one's major course of study and in one's professional career. True education also facilitates an understanding of oneself, and tolerance and respect for the viewpoints of others. Courses in psychology, sociology, and anthropology all serve these ends. 'True' education also provides insight and perspective regarding one's place in society and in the physical and metaphysical worlds. Courses in political science, philosophy, theology, and even sciences such as astronomy and physics can help a student gain this insight and perspective. Finally, no student can be truly educated without having gained an aesthetic appreciation of the world around us--through coursework in literature, the fine arts, and the performing arts.\n\nBecoming truly educated also requires sufficient mastery of one academic area to permit a student to contribute meaningfully to society later in life. Yet, mastery of any specific area requires some knowledge about a variety of others. For example, a political-science student can fully understand that field only by understanding the various psychological, sociological, and historical forces that shape political ideology. An anthropologist cannot excel without understanding the social and political events that shape cultures, and without some knowledge of chemistry and geology for performing fieldwork. Even computer engineering is intrinsically tied to other fields, even non-technical ones such as business, communications, and media.\n\nNevertheless, the call for a broad educational experience as the path to becoming truly educated comes with one important caveat. A student who merely dabbles in a hodgepodge of academic offerings, without special emphasis on any one, becomes a dilettante lacking enough knowledge or experience in any single area to come away with anything valuable to offer. Thus, in the pursuit of true education, students must be careful not to overextend themselves or risk defeating an important objective of education.\n\nIn the final analysis, to become truly educated one must strike a proper balance in one's educational pursuits. Certainly, students should strive to excel in the specific requirements of their major course of study. However, they should complement those efforts by pursuing coursework in a variety of other areas as well. By earnestly pursuing a broad education one gains the capacity not only to succeed in a career but also to find purpose and meaning in that career as well as to understand and appreciate the world and its peoples. To gain these capacities is to become 'truly educated.'"

    "question": "People work more productively in teams than individually. Teamwork requires cooperation, which motivates people much more than individual competition does.",
    "answer": "The speaker asserts that because teamwork requires cooperative effort, people are more motivated and therefore more productive working in teams than working individually as competitors. My view is that this assertion is true only in some cases. If one examines the business world, for example, it becomes clear that which approach is more effective in motivating people and in achieving productivity depends on the specific job.\n\nIn some jobs, productivity clearly depends on the ability of coworkers to cooperate as members of a team. For businesses involved in the production of products through complex processes, all departments and divisions must work in lock-step fashion toward product roll-out. Cooperative interaction is even essential in jobs performed in relative isolation and in jobs in which technical knowledge or ability, not the ability to work with others, would seem to be most important. For example, scientists, researchers, and even computer programmers must collaborate to establish common goals, coordinate efforts, and meet timelines. Moreover, the kinds of people attracted to these jobs in the first place are likely to be motivated by a sense of common purpose rather than by individual ambition.\n\nIn other types of jobs, individual competition, tenacity, and ambition are the keys to productivity. For example, a commissioned salesperson's compensation, and sometimes tenure and potential for promotion as well, is based on comparative sales performance of coworkers. Working as competitors, a firm's individual salespeople maximize productivity—in terms of profit—both for themselves and for their firm. Key leadership positions also call, above all, for a certain tenacity and competitive spirit. A firm's founding entrepreneur must maintain this spirit in order for the firm to survive, let alone to maximize productivity. Moreover, in my observation, the kinds of people inclined toward entrepreneurship and sales in the first place are those who are competitive by nature, not those who are motivated primarily by a sense of common purpose.\n\nOn balance, however, my view is that cooperation is more crucial for an organization's long-term productivity than individual competition. Even in jobs where individual competitiveness is part and parcel of the job, the importance of cooperation should not be underestimated. Competition among salespeople can quickly grow into jealousy, backstabbing, and unethical behavior, all of which are counterproductive. And even the most successful entrepreneurs would no doubt admit that without the cooperative efforts of their subordinates, partners, and colleagues, their personal visions would never become reality.\n\nIn sum, individual competitiveness and ambition are essential motivating forces for certain types of jobs, while in other jobs, it is a common sense of mission that motivates workers to achieve maximum productivity. In the final analysis, however, the overall productivity of almost every organization depends ultimately on the ability of its members to cooperate as a team."

    "question": "Colleges and universities should offer more courses on popular music, film, advertising, and television because contemporary culture has much greater relevance for students than do arts and literature of the past.",
    "answer": "The speaker asserts that the curriculum of colleges and universities should emphasize popular culture--music, media, literature, and so forth rather than literature and art of the past, for the reason that the former is more relevant to students. I strongly disagree. Although courses in popular culture do play a legitimate role in higher education, formal study of the present culture at the expense of studying past cultures can undermine the function of higher education, and ultimately provide a disservice to students and to society.\n\nAdmittedly, course work in popular culture is legitimate and valuable for three reasons. First, popular culture is a mirror of society's impulses and values. Thus, any serious student of the social sciences, as well as students of media and communications, should take seriously the literature and art of the present. Secondly, in every age and culture some worthwhile art and literature emerges from the mediocrity. Few would disagree, for example, that the great modem-jazz pioneers such as Charlie Parker and Thelonius Monk, and more recently Lennon and McCarmey, and Stevie Wonder, have made just as lasting a contribution to music as some of the great classical musicians of previous centuries. Thirdly, knowledge of popular films, music, and art enables a person to find common ground to relate to other people. This leads to better communication between different subcultures.\n\nNevertheless, emphasizing the study of popular culture at the expense of studying classical art and literature can carry harmful consequences for students, as well as for society. Without the benefit of historical perspective gamed through the earnest study of the art and literature of the past, it is impossible to fully understand, appreciate, and critique literature and art of the present. Moreover, by approaching popular culture without any yardstick for quality it is impossible to distinguish mediocre art from worthwhile art. Only by studying the classics can an individual develop fair standards for judging popular works. Besides, emphasis on the formal study of popular culture is unnecessary. Education in popular culture is readily available outside the classroom---on the Internet, through educational television programming, and through the sorts of everyday conversations and cross-talk that occur at water coolers and in the coffee houses of any college campus.\n\nIn sum, while the study of popular literature and art can be worthwhile, it has to be undertaken in conjunction with an even greater effort to learn about the literature and art of the past. In the absence of the latter, our universities will produce a society of people with no cultural perspective, and without any standards for determining what merits our attention and nurtures society."

    "question": "A person's own habits and attitudes often limit that person's freedom more than do restrictions imposed by others.",
    "answer": "I strongly agree with the contention that we often limit our own freedom through our habits and attitudes. By limiting our own freedom, we often serve our own interests. And as we learn this lesson, we cultivate certain attitudes and habits--particularly in our relationships with others --by which we apply that lesson, and which continue throughout life.\n\nTo appreciate that from an early age we ingrain in ourselves habits that serve to constrain our freedom, one need look no further than the neighborhood playground. Even without adult supervision, a group of youngsters at play invariably establish mutually agreed-upon rules of conduct--whether or not a sport or game is involved. Children learn that without any rules for behavior the playground bully usually prevails. Thus our habit of making choices that constrain our own freedom stems from our desire to protect our own interests, and it begins at an early age.\n\nThis habit of making choices that constrain our own freedom continues into our adult lives. As we mature, most of us develop the attitude that monogamous relationships are preferable to polygamous ones--thus our habit of entering into exclusive pair-bonding relationships. During our teens we agree to 'go steady,' then as adults we voluntarily enter into marriage contracts. As we enter the working world, we carry these attitudes and habits with us. We eagerly engage in exclusive employment relationships---with the attitude that the security of steady income is preferable to the 'freedom' of not knowing where our next paycheck will come from. Even people who prefer self-employment to job security quickly develop the attitude that the only way to preserve their autonomy is to constrain themselves in terms of their agreements with clients and customers, and especially in terms of how they use their time.\n\nThose who disagree that we tend to restrict our own freedom through our habits and attitudes involving personal and employment relationships might cite the often-heard complaint about life's circumstances leaving one with 'no choice.' One complaining person might feel trapped in a job or a marriage, by their boss or partner. Another complainant might blame his or her spendthrift habits on enticing advertisements, the pressure to appear successful, and so forth. However, people in situations such as these are not actually at the mercy of others. Instead, they have a significant degree of personal freedom, but simply choose one alternative over others that might be less appealing or even self-defeating. For example, almost every person who blames someone else for being trapped in a job is simply choosing to retain a certain measure of financial security. The choice to forego this security is always available, although it might carry unpleasant consequences.\n\nThat through our attitudes we serve to constrain our own freedom is evident on a societal level as well. Just as children at a playground quickly develop the habit of imposing rules and regulations on themselves, as a society we do the same. After all, in a democracy our system of laws is an invention of the people. For example, we insist on being bound by restrictions for operating motor vehicles, for buying and selling both real and personal property, and for making public statements about other people. Without these restrictions, we would live in continual fear for our physical safety, the security of our property, and our personal reputation and dignity. Thus most of the rules and regulations we claim are imposed on us we have ultimately imposed on ourselves, as a society, in order to protect ourselves.\n\nIn the final analysis, in contending that our habits and attitudes 'often' serve to restrict our freedom more than restraints that others place on us do, the statement does not even go far enough. Despite our occasional sense that others are restricting our choices, on both an individual and a societal level we are ultimately the ones who, through our attitudes and habits, limit our own freedom."

    "question": "In any realm of life---whether academic, social, business, or political---the only way to succeed is to take a practical, rather than an idealistic, point of view. Pragmatic behavior guarantees survival, whereas idealistic views tend to be superseded by simpler, more immediate options.",
    "answer": "I agree with the speaker insofar as that a practical, pragmatic approach toward our endeavors can help us survive in the short term. However, idealism is just as crucial if not more so--for long-term success in any endeavor, whether it be in academics, business, or political and social reform.\n\nWhen it comes to academics, students who we would consider pragmatic tend not to pursue an education for its own sake. Instead, they tend to cut whatever corners are needed to optimize their grade average and survive the current academic term. But, is this approach the only way to succeed academically? Certainly not. Students who earnestly pursue intellectual paths that truly interest them are more likely to come away with a meaningful and lasting education. In fact, a sense of mission about one's area of fascination is strong motivation to participate actively in class and to study earnestly, both of which contribute to better grades in that area. Thus, although the idealist-student might sacrifice a high overall grade average, the depth of knowledge, academic discipline, and sense of purpose the student gains will serve that student well later in life.\n\nIn considering the business world it might be more tempting to agree with the speaker; after all, isn't business fundamentally about pragmatism--that is, \"getting the job done\" and paying attention to the \"bottom line\"? Emphatically, no. Admittedly, the everyday machinations of business are very much about meeting mundane short-term goals: deadlines for production, sales quotas, profit margins, and so forth. Yet underpinning these activities is the vision of the company's chief executive --a vision which might extend far beyond mere profit maximization to the ways in which the firm can make a lasting and meaningful contribution to the community, to the broader economy, and to the society as a whole. Without a dream or vision--that is, without strong idealist leadership--a firm can easily be cast about in the sea of commerce without clear direction, threatening not only the firm's bottom line but also its very survival.\n\nFinally, when it comes to the political arena, again at first blush it might appear that pragmatism is the best, if not the only, way to succeed. Most politicians seem driven by their interest in being elected and reelected--that is, in surviving--rather than by any sense of mission, or even obligation to their constituency or country. Diplomatic and legal maneuverings and negotiations often appear intended to meet the practical needs of the parties involved--minimizing costs, preserving options, and so forth. But, it is idealists-not pragmatists--who sway the masses, incite revolutions, and make political ideology reality. Consider idealists such as America's founders, Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin Luther King. Had these idealists concerned themselves with short-term survival and immediate needs rather than with their notions of an ideal society, the United States and India might still be British colonies, and African-Americans might still be relegated to the backs of buses."

    "question": "The study of history has value only to the extent that it is relevant to our daily lives.",
    "answer": "The speaker alleges that studying history is valuable only insofar as it is relevant to our daily lives. I find this allegation to be specious. It wrongly suggests that history is not otherwise instructive and that its relevance to our everyday lives is limited. To the contrary, studying history provides inspiration, innumerable lessons for living, and useful value-clarification and perspective ---all of which help us decide how to live our lives.\n\nTo begin with, learning about great human achievements of the past provides inspiration. For example, a student inspired by the courage and tenacity of history's great explorers might decide as a result to pursue a career in archeology, oceanography, or astronomy. This decision can, in turn, profoundly affect that student's everyday life--in school and beyond. Even for students not inclined to pursue these sorts of careers, studying historical examples of courage in the face of adversity can provide motivation to face their own personal fears in life. In short, learning about grand accomplishments of the past can help us get through the everyday business of living, whatever that business might be, by emboldening us and lifting our spirits.\n\nIn addition, mistakes of the past can teach us as a society how to avoid repeating those mistakes. For example, history can teach us the inappropriateness of addressing certain social issues, particularly moral ones, on a societal level. Attempts to legislate morality invariably fail, as aptly illustrated by the Prohibition experiment in the U.S. during the 1930s. Hopefully, as a society we can apply this lesson by adopting a more enlightened legislative approach toward such issues as free speech, criminalization of drug use, criminal justice, and equal rights under the law.\n\nStudying human history can also help us understand and appreciate the mores, values, and ideals of past cultures. A heightened awareness of cultural evolution, in turn, helps us formulate informed and reflective values and ideals for ourselves. Based on these values and ideals, students can determine their authentic life path as well as how they should allot their time and interact with others on a day-to-day basis.\n\nFinally, it might be tempting to imply from the speaker's allegation that studying history has little relevance even for the mundane chores that occupy so much of our time each day, and therefore is of little value. However, from history we learn not to take everyday activities and things for granted. By understanding the history of money and banking we can transform an otherwise routine trip to the bank into an enlightened experience, or a visit to the grocery store into an homage to the many inventors, scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs of the past who have made such convenience possible today. And, we can fully appreciate our freedom to go about our daily lives largely as we choose only by understanding our political heritage. In short, appreciating history can serve to elevate our everyday chores to richer, more interesting, and more enjoyable experiences.\n\nIn sum, the speaker fails to recognize that in all our activities and decisions--from our grandest to our most rote--history can inspire, inform, guide, and nurture. In the final analysis, to study history is to gain the capacity to be more human--and I would be hard-pressed to imagine a worthier end."

    "question": "It is primarily through formal education that a culture tries to perpetuate the ideas it favors and discredit the ideas it fears.",
    "answer": "The speaker asserts that a culture perpetuates the ideas it favors while discrediting those it fears primarily through formal education. I agree that grade-school, and even high-school, education involves cultural indoctrination. Otherwise, I think the speaker misunderstands the role of higher education, and overlooks other means by which a culture achieves these ends.\n\nI agree with the speaker with respect to formal grade-school and even high-school education--which to some extent amount to indoctrination with the values, ideas, and principles of mainstream society. In my observation, young students are not taught to question authority, to take issue with what they are taught, or to think critically for themselves. Yet, this indoctrination is actually desirable to an extent. Sole emphasis on rote learning of facts and figures is entirely appropriate for grade-school children, who have not yet gained the intellectual capacity and real-world experience to move up to higher, more complex levels of thinking. Nevertheless, the degree to which our grade schools and high schools emphasize indoctrination should not be overstated. After all, cultural mores, values, and biases have little to do with education in the natural sciences, mathematics, and specific language skills such as reading and writing.\n\nAlthough the speaker's assertion has some merit when it comes to the education of young people, I find it erroneous when it comes to higher education. The mission of our colleges and universities is to afford students cultural perspective and a capacity for understanding opposing viewpoints, and to encourage and nurture the skills of critical analysis and skepticism--not to indoctrinate students with certain ideas while quashing others. Admittedly, colleges and universities are bureaucracies and therefore not immune to political influence over what is taught and what is not. Thus to some extent a college's curriculum is vulnerable to wealthy and otherwise influential benefactors, trustees, and government agencies who by advancing the prevailing cultural agenda serve to diminish a college's effectiveness in carrying out its true mission. Yet, my intuition is that that such influences are minor ones, especially in public university systems.\n\nThe speaker's assertion is also problematic in that it ignores two significant other means by which our culture perpetuates ideas it favors and discredits ideas it fears. One such means is our system of laws, by which legislators and jurists formulate and then impose so-called 'public policy.' Legislation and judicial decisions carry the weight of law and the threat of punishment for those who deviate from that law. As a result, they are highly effective means of forcing on us official notions of what is good for society and for quashing ideas that are deemed threatening to the social fabric, and to the safety and security of the government and the governed. A second such means is the mainstream media. By mirroring the culture's prevailing ideas and values, broadcast and print media serve to perpetuate them. It is important to distinguish here between mainstream media-such as broadcast television--and alternative media such as documentary films and non-commercial websites, whose typical aims are to call into question the status quo, expose the hypocrisy and unfair bias behind mainstream ideas, and bring to light ideas that the powers-that-be most fear. Yet, the influence of alternative media pales in comparison to that of mainstream media.\n\nIn sum, the speaker's assertion is not without merit when it comes to the role of grade schools and high schools."

    "question": "In many countries it is now possible to turn on the television and view government at work. Watching these proceedings can help people understand the issues that affect their lives. The more kinds of government proceedings---trials, debates, meetings, etc.---that are televised, the more society will benefit.",
    "answer": "I strongly agree that the more government proceedings--debates, meetings, and so forth---that are televised, the more society will benefit overall. Nevertheless, undue emphasis on this means of informing a constituency has the potential for harm--which any society must take care not to allow.\n\nAccess to government proceedings via television carries several significant benefits. The main benefit lies in two useful archival functions of videotaped proceedings. First, videotapes are valuable supplements to conventional means of record keeping. Although written transcripts and audio tapes might provide an accurate record of what is said, only video tapes can convey the body language and other visual clues that help us understand what people say, whether they are being disingenuous, sarcastic, or sincere. Secondly, videotape archives provide a useful catalog for documentary journalists.\n\nTelevised proceedings also provide three other useful functions. First, for shut-ins and people who live in remote regions, it might be impracticable, or even impossible, to view government proceedings in person. Secondly, with satellite television systems it is possible to witness the governments of other cities, states, and even nations at work. This sort of exposure provides the viewer a valuable sense of perspective, an appreciation for other forms of government, and so forth. Thirdly, in high schools and universities, television proceedings can be useful curriculum supplements for students of government, public policy, law, and even public speaking.\n\nNevertheless, televising more and more government proceedings carries certain risks that should not be ignored. Watching televised government proceedings is inherently a rather passive experience. The viewer cannot voice his or her opinions, objections, or otherwise contribute to what is being viewed. Watching televised proceedings as a substitute for active participation in the political process can, on a mass scale, undermine the democratic process by way of its chilling effect on participation. Undue emphasis on televised government poses the risk that government proceedings will become mere displays, or shows, for the public, intended as public relations ploys and so-called 'photo opportunities,' while the true business of government is moved behind closed doors.\n\nIn sum, readier access to the day-to-day business of a government can only serve to inform and educate. Although undue reliance on televised proceedings for information can quell active involvement and serve as a censor for people being televised, I think these are risks worth taking in the interest of disclosure."
