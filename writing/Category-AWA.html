      <h2 id="educationandlearning">1. Education and Learning</h2>

      <h3>A. Curriculum Design & Course Requirements</h3>
      <div class="sub-section">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Universities should require every student to take a variety of
            courses outside the student's field of study
          </li>
          <li>
            A nation should require all of its students to study the same
            national curriculum until they enter college
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to become well-rounded individuals, all college students
            should be required to take courses in which they read poetry,
            novels, mythology, and other types of imaginative literature
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Claim:</strong> Universities should require every student to
            take a variety of courses outside the student's major field of
            study. <strong>Reason:</strong> Acquiring knowledge of various
            academic disciplines is the best way to become truly educated
          </li>
          <li>
            Colleges and universities should require their students to spend at
            least one semester studying in a foreign country
          </li>
          <li>
            All college and university students would benefit from spending at
            least one semester studying in a foreign country
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>B. Teaching Methods and Assessment</h3>
      <div class="sub-section">
        <ul>
          <li>
            The best way to teach is to praise positive actions and ignore
            negative ones
          </li>
          <li>
            Educators should base their assessment of students' learning not on
            students' grasp of facts but on the ability to explain the ideas,
            trends, and concepts that those facts illustrate
          </li>
          <li>
            Educators should teach facts only after their students have studied
            the ideas, trends, and concepts that help explain those facts
          </li>
          <li>
            Group assignments that students must work together to complete
            should replace a substantial amount of traditional lecture-based
            instruction
          </li>
          <li>
            Teachers' salaries should be based on their students' academic
            performance
          </li>
          <li>
            Some people believe that the most important qualities of an
            effective teacher are understanding and empathy. Others believe that
            it is more important for teachers to be rigorous and demanding
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>C. Student Interests and Motivation</h3>
      <div class="sub-section">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Educators should find out what students want included in the
            curriculum and then offer it to them
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Claim:</strong> When planning courses, educators should take
            into account the interests and suggestions of their students.
            <strong>Reason:</strong> Students are more motivated to learn when
            they are interested in what they are studying
          </li>
          <li>
            Educators should take students' interests into account when planning
            the content of the courses they teach
          </li>
          <li>
            Learning is primarily a matter of personal discipline; students
            cannot be motivated by school or college alone
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>D. Career-Oriented Education</h3>
      <div class="sub-section">
        <ul>
          <li>
            College students should base their choice of a field of study on the
            availability of jobs in that field
          </li>
          <li>
            College students should be encouraged to pursue subjects that
            interest them rather than the courses that seem most likely to lead
            to jobs
          </li>
          <li>
            Educational institutions should actively encourage their students to
            choose fields of study in which jobs are plentiful
          </li>
          <li>
            Educational institutions should actively encourage their students to
            choose fields of study that will prepare them for lucrative careers
          </li>
          <li>
            Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students
            from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>E. Learning Environment and Technology</h3>
      <div class="sub-section">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Students should always question what they are taught instead of
            accepting it passively
          </li>
          <li>
            Competition for high grades seriously limits the quality of learning
            at all levels of education
          </li>
          <li>
            Although innovations such as video, computers, and the Internet seem
            to offer schools improved methods for instructing students, these
            technologies all too often distract from real learning
          </li>
          <li>
            Some people believe that the purpose of education is to free the
            mind and the spirit. Others believe that formal education tends to
            restrain our minds and spirits
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>F. Access and Equality in Education</h3>
      <div class="sub-section">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Governments should offer college and university education free of
            charge to all students
          </li>
          <li>
            Governments should offer a free university education to any student
            who has been admitted to a university but who cannot afford the
            tuition
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3>A. Role and Responsibilities of Government</h3>
      <div class="sub-section">
        <ul>
          <li>
            The primary goal of technological advancement should be to increase
            people’s efficiency so that they have more leisure time
          </li>
          <li>
            Nations should pass laws to preserve any remaining wilderness areas
            in their natural state
          </li>
          <li>
            The well-being of a society is enhanced when many of its people
            question authority
          </li>
          <li>
            Governments should place few, if any, restrictions on scientific
            research and development
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>B. Leadership and Decision-Making</h3>
      <div class="sub-section">
        <ul>
          <li>Leaders are created by the demands that are placed on them</li>
          <li>
            Some people believe that the most effective leaders are those who
            maintain a strong focus on pursuing a particular goal and refuse to
            be distracted by other concerns
          </li>
          <li>
            Some people believe that in order to be effective, political leaders
            must yield to public opinion and abandon principle for the sake of
            compromise
          </li>
          <li>
            The best leaders are those who encourage feedback from the people
            whom they lead
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>C. International Relations and Law</h3>
      <div class="sub-section">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Claim: The best way to understand the character of a society is to
            examine the character of the men and women that the society chooses
            as its heroes or its role models
          </li>
          <li>
            It is primarily through our identification with social groups that
            we define ourselves

      <div class="sub-section">
        <ul>
          <li>
            As we acquire more knowledge, things do not become more
            comprehensible, but more complex and mysterious

          <li>

            The best way to solve environmental problems caused by
